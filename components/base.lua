-- Callbacks

-- Stops any world behavior the component is in the middle of.  This is generally called when a
-- component is about to be removed or the actor's state is about to be reset to some known basic
-- state, and it should undo any temporary changes the component has made â€” e.g., for Climb this
-- lets go of a ladder, and for fox flux it cancels special moves in progress.  (It should also
-- reset decisions, so the actor doesn't immediately perform the action again in the same frame.)
-- As a subtler example, Jump:stop() cancels the jump, which actively alters the actor's velocity,
-- because that's the expected behavior of "stopping a jump", no matter what causes it to happen.
-- Note that this is NOT for undoing modifications made when the component is first added to the
-- actor; that sort of lifecycle behavior is not (currently) part of this interface.
function Component:stop()
end

-- Regular update, called once per frame
